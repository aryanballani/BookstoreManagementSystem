# Class12_Final-Project
We have made a book store management system using python and SQL. It provides an easy and convenient means for storing various details about books that one may have in a store in the form of a table in an SQL database. It stores information about the different types of transactions that take place on a given book and also helps to keep inventory of each book type in an efficient manner. It can perform five operations : 
1. Addition of items
2. Display the entire inventory
3. Give details about specific items from the database
4. Keep track of sale of books
5. Keep track of books that have been issued on rent
